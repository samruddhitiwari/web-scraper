Google Docs to Excel Extractor
This Python script automates the extraction of content from a Google Docs document and saves it into an Excel workbook. The script uses Selenium WebDriver to navigate through the Google Docs webpage, fetch the content, and then writes it to an Excel file using the openpyxl library.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Selenium WebDriver
Chrome WebDriver
openpyxl library
Installation
Step 1: Install Python
If you haven't installed Python yet, download and install it from python.org.

Step 2: Install Required Packages
Install the required Python packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install selenium openpyxl
Step 3: Download Chrome WebDriver
Download the Chrome WebDriver compatible with your Chrome browser version from ChromeDriver Downloads.

Extract the downloaded file and place the chromedriver.exe in a directory included in your system's PATH or provide the path to chromedriver.exe in the script.

Usage
Replace the Google Docs URL in the script with the URL of the document you want to extract.
Run the script:
bash
Copy code
python google_docs_to_excel.py
Wait for the script to complete the extraction process.
Check the generated extracted_data.xlsx file for the extracted content.
Script Explanation
The script uses Selenium to open a new Chrome WebDriver instance and navigates to the provided Google Docs URL.
After waiting for the document to load, it finds the document content and extracts the text.
The extracted text is then split into lines and written into an Excel workbook.
The script saves the Excel workbook as extracted_data.xlsx.
Notes
Ensure that you have access to the Google Docs document you want to extract.
Adjust the waiting time (time.sleep()) in the script if needed, based on your internet speed and document size.
This script assumes that the headings in the Google Docs document start with the word "Heading". Adjust the script logic if your headings are formatted differently.
